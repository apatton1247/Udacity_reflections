When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping your work local?

One of the great parts of using a remote repository, like ones hosted on Github, is
that you free yourself from the constraint of working on just one machine. When you
use a remote repository, you have a central workspace accessible from anywhere, if
you know where to find it, and you or someone else can work on the same project from
different computers.  This makes group work much easier as well.
